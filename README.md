# Bias in Mate Selection for Speed Meeting

The study of dating preferences and biases has been an area of research interest for many years. Scientists conduct various dating experiments to record people’s performance and action during the dating, and furthermore, build models to explore the reason of successful dating. The trained models will, however, reflect the data’s biases towards particular demographic groupings, but few researchers have paid attention to them. In our work, we build regression models combined with pre-processing techniques to perform the dating successful rate prediction, and deploy a number of evaluation mechanisms combined with visualizations to identify the inherent race and gender biases that exist in the predictions. Beyond that, we demonstrate that the racial bias existed in the dating experiment significantly influence the dating decision.

Our team achieved our objectives through 3 steps: 1. Data Preprocessing with users' characteristics and KNN 2. Predicting successful match rate with 4 regression models: Linear Regression, PCR, Ridge Regression, and Logistic Regression 3. Exploring racial and gender bias and how the bias affect match rate with MSE combined with data visualizations

Since this project focuses on exploring bias, we spent more time in data preprocessing and bias exploration with simple regression models.
